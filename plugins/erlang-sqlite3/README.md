# Erlang wrapper for SQLite3

This library allows you to work with SQLite3 databases from Erlang.

It is compatible with Windows and Linux, and should probably work on other OSes as well.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alexeyr/erlang-sqlite3.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alexeyr/erlang-sqlite3)

See also [esqlite](https://github.com/mmzeeman/esqlite) for an alternative library.

## Requirements

Erlang/OTP R14B or later is required (tested up to 17.3 at this writing), and SQLite 3 minimum version is 3.6.1.

## Compiling

### Linux

1. Install SQLite3 by running `sudo apt-get install sqlite3` or the equivalent for your package manager, or by [compiling from the source](http://source.online.free.fr/Linux_HowToCompileSQLite.html).

2. `make`.

### Cross-compiling

If you want to use erlang-sqlite3 on an embedded device, it can be cross-compiled.

1. Cross-compile [SQLite3](http://www.sqlite.org/cvstrac/wiki?p=HowToCompile) and [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/doc/installation_guide/INSTALL-CROSS.html).

2. Change variables and paths in `rebar.cross_compile.config.sample` to the desired values and rename it to `rebar.cross_compile.config`.

3. `make cross_compile`.

### Windows with MS Visual C++

To build both SQLite3 and sqlite3-erlang:

1. If MSVC tools (`cl`, `link`, etc.) are not in the path, run `vcvars32.bat` or `vcvars64.bat` depending on whether you use 32-bit or 64-bit Erlang. `build_port_win32.bat` and `build_port_win64.bat` have the standard paths for VC10.0.

2. `nmake`.

Alternately, you can use prebuilt versions of `sqlite3.dll` and `sqlite3.def`. To make `sqlite3.lib`, use `lib /def:sqlite3.def`. Then remove `sqlite3.dll` and `sqlite3.lib` targets from `Makefile` and do as above.

### Potential compilation problems

* If SQLite was built with `SQLITE_OMIT_LOAD_EXTENSION` option, you'll need to undefine `ERLANG_SQLITE3_LOAD_EXTENSION` macro in <c_src/sqlite3_drv.h>.

## Running the test suite

### Linux

`make test`

### Windows

1. `nmake tests`

2. If you get the error `"Error loading sqlite3_drv: The specified module could not be found"`, this is because `sqlite3.dll` isn't in the search path.

## Example usage

See tests `test/sqlite3_test.erl` for a starting point. On Windows note that `sqlite3.dll` must be in your application's working directory or somewhere in the DLL search path.
