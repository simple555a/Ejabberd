  A calendar implentation that follows to ISO8601.

  This calendar implements the proleptic Gregorian calendar and
  is therefore compatible with the calendar used in most countries
  today. The proleptic means the Gregorian rules for leap years are
  applied for all time, consequently the dates give different results
  before the year 1583 from when the Gregorian calendar was adopted.
